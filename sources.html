                Leadership and Self Deception is about taking responsibility. It’s about not judging others. Don’t get stuck in the box.
                Leadership soft skills vs hard skills.
                Leadership can be broken down into responsibility, self-awareness, respect, compassion, vision, communication, learning agility, collaboration/delegation, influence, integrity, courage, gratitude, and resilience.
                Hard skills include: planning, organizing, getting the right people in the right positions, having and communicating a clear vision consistently, executing a plan, being accountable for results/create a culture of accountability, establishing a good culture, teaching true principles effectively.
                
                Knowledge of others:
                Compassion/empathy (Connection), respect, recognition (truly perceiving those around you)
                Action with others:
                Collaboration, delegation, influence, communication (Have to take your vision and give out)
                Knowledge of yourself:
                Self-awareness, gratitude, integrity
                Action within yourself
                Courage, resilience, vision, learning agility, be curious (Think and analyze), comfort with ambiguity
                
                4 Modules: Small “l” leadership
                There would be a lot of overlap between leadership with others and leadership within yourself. The difference is perspective.
                One for the stuff about yourself- I need to build a portfolio of data about how to improve yourself.
                One for the stuff about others- I need to research caring for people, connecting with people, etc.
                One for personal finance and budgeting- I need accounting, math, personal finance, Dave Ramsey stuff, personal responsibility, and planning for the future.
                One for learning how to learn- I need to research the many styles of learning and how to recognize how you learn best.

                Sessions probably shouldn’t go longer than 30 minutes. (eLearning Industry)
                I want people to be able to go through my modules quickly but come back and spend more time on them.
                They need to be engaging with a lot of smaller sections.
                “Lesson 1: You have a short window of time for training to make an impression. Regardless of your course length—come out strong to set the hook, and find ways to keep it there.”
                “When it comes to training, learners can—and will—sit through lengthy training with high production values or high interest levels. In the eLearning world this usually means lots of visuals, interactive elements, an appealing tone and style, and a polished presentation.”
                “Lesson 3: Long or short, be prepared to back up the training with recurring touchstones that help people recall the essentials.”
                I’ve been thinking about my Physics course. It builds on itself really while, and that’s because everything you learn continues to be used.
                “Lesson 4: Don’t be afraid to break content into smaller chunks. It gives employees a chance to master what you’ve taught them and to discover information on their own. Plus, chunks give you more flexibility.”
                Best way to see what content you need is to speak to an expert.
                Complexity of interactive elements must be considered.
                Elements include your built interactive elements, text, videos, and images.
                Ideally, you would base your content on your audience. (My audience is a little general for that)
                Pay attention to navigability. Focus on one thing at a time. Simple graphics and interaction.
                “Gamification in eLearning is an approach that helps increase learners' engagement and motivation.”
                Quick interactive quizzes. Should have rewards and instant feedback. Community features.
                “Step 5: Testing And Deployment (Because Bugs Belong In Nature, Not In Your App)
                Before launching, run extensive testing:
                1.	Functional testing
                Ensure every button, quiz, and video plays smoothly.
                2.	Performance testing
                Nobody likes an app that crashes mid-lesson.
                3.	Security testing
                Protect user data like it is the secret formula to Coca-Cola.

                “The biggest difference between course and lesson-level objectives is that we don’t directly assess course-level objectives. Course-level objectives are just too broad. Instead, we use several lesson-level outcomes to demonstrate mastery of one course-level outcome.  To create good course-level objectives, we need to ask ourselves: “What do I want the students to have mastery of at the end of the course?””

                Learn
                Expose yourself to many situations and experiences.
                Everyone has their own blind spots. Work to overcome your own.
                “Learn to see the world the way it really is, not how you wish it to be.” (Andy Pearson).
                “If you want to see the world the way it really is, you’ve got to hunt for the truth.”
                Patterns- Create something larger than the sum of its parts. Expose yourself to many ideas and patterns. Pattern thinking comes from being involved in multiple disciplines.
                Don’t wait for inspiration to make the leap. Work for the leap.
                Develop a practice of reflection. Make time for honest, vulnerable conversations with yourself.
                You need quiet moments to just think and process.
                “Humility is just the recognition that you can’t do it by yourself” and “Confidence is simply the expectation that you’ll find a way to win, somehow.” Both are necessary.
                Celebrate the ideas of others.
                Pursuing what you enjoy sparks joy in others. Loop of learning and innovation.
                Be your authentic self. Otherwise, you have to work at being someone else as well.
                Do the right thing- it provides the most value
                The most effective thing a leader can do is to give an overarching culture and unity.
                People should be the priority, not knowledge or results.
                To lead, you must have genuine concern for those you are leading. Take care of people and you will see results.
                
                Leadership and Self-Deception
                By The Arbinger Institute
                The self-aware aspect of Self-Deception
                Self-deception is in our natural experience. It blinds us to what we do not see. It hides our true problems so we cannot see that we are making things worse.
                From our perspective, we’re doing the right thing. We made sacrifices. We worked hard.
                The big problem at our heart is that we can’t see that we have a problem.
                We can’t solve our problems unless we can acknowledge that we have a problem.
                “That’s self-deception—the inability to see that one has a problem.”
                When we blame others, we engage in self-deception and self-justification which leads to us seeing people as objects in the way. This creates a feedback loop of blame and negativity that provokes the behavior we don’t want.
                “We provoke each other to do more of what we say we don’t like about the other!”
                “Living the material
                •	Don’t try to be perfect. Do try to be better.
                •	Don’t use the vocabulary—“the box,” and so on—with people who don’t already know it. Do use the principles in your own life.
                •	Don’t look for others’ boxes. Do look for your own.
                •	Don’t accuse others of being in the box. Do try to stay out of the box yourself.
                •	Don’t give up on yourself when you discover you’ve been in the box. Do keep trying.
                •	Don’t deny you’ve been in the box when you have been. Do apologize, then just keep marching forward, trying to be more helpful to others in the future.
                •	Don’t focus on what others are doing wrong. Do focus on what you can do right to help.
                •	Don’t worry whether others are helping you. Do worry whether you are helping others.”

                Leadership Without (Leading others):
                Knowledge of others:
                Compassion/empathy (Connection), respect, recognition (truly perceiving those around you)
                Action with others:
                Collaboration, delegation, influence, communication (Have to take your vision and give out)
                Listen to your underlings. They should be able to tell that you listened.
                Church Operational Talents (More detail in the images I have of the packet)- Define direction, counsel together, build capability, organize the work, accomplish the work, and render an account.
                Co-create spiritually, vision and mind, and then physically.

                Seek out people who will say the painful truth.
                Leaders understand they should trust that others have positive intentions. Someone has to trust first to break inertia.
                Create environments that eliminate fear. People will be more likely to speak up and innovate.

                Leadership and Self-Deception
                By The Arbinger Institute
                Taking time for your employees.
                Treating people well at face value isn’t really treating them well. You need to care about your employees.
                People problems can all come down to self-deception.
                “we can tell how other people feel about us, and it’s to that that we respond.”
                How do we see people? Do we see them as a nuisance or a threat? Are they in the way? Are you happy for them to consider taking the seat next to you or do you dislike the idea that someone might take the seat next to you?
                Do you see things clearly, as they truly are? Do you see people as they truly are?
                Whether or not others are right, are you seeing them as people who are equal to you or are you seeing them as a problem?
                “And that’s because they don’t know how much smarter smart people are, how much more skilled skilled people get, and how much harder hardworking people work when they see, and are seen, straightforwardly—as people.”
                We naturally see people as people and want to help them. Not doing so is an act of self-betrayal.
                Don’t focus on yourself. See others as people.
                When we engage in self-deception and self-justification, we blame others and get blame back.
                “We provoke each other to do more of what we say we don’t like about the other!”

                Personal Finance
                I want to focus on the behavioral aspects. What should you be doing to improve your behavior? How do you take financial responsibility? I also want to give access to tools. I want to make recommendations that these might be useful for budgeting. I don’t want to be a budgeting tool.
                
                Calculate Net Income- take home pay
                Track Spending- group fixed expenses together and variable expenses together
                Set goals- Short term (next couple years) and long term. I think goals are where a lot of people fail because they don’t have something to work towards.
                Take everything and make a plan
                50/30/20 budget is 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% saving or extra debt payments
                Envelope budget is putting money for each category in an envelope and not spending anymore when you run out.
                Zero-based budget- everything budgeted down to 0.
                Pay yourself first budget- give yourself savings first
                Adjust spending - cut wants first then fixed expenses
                Budgeting as a family- communication. You both have goals and wants. You should care about the other person’s goals.
                Emergency fund- for surprise expenses. Ideally, it will be 3-6 months of expenses.
                If you exceed your budget, review it and ask what is happening. Impulse buys? Needs?
                Focus on small gains. Don’t get discouraged.

                I have three ways to improve what you can get.
                Make more money, spend money more efficiently, reduce how much interest you’re paying.
                I would recommend wariness in getting rich quick. It’s almost never that simple.
                I should research properties of good banks to use.
                
                Studies show that high financial literacy puts you in a better financial position.

                A budget helps you save money and feel less stress.
                Having a plan with goals helps you remain focused and motivated. It helps bring thinking into the equation of spending.

                Spending and thinking about spending releases dopamine. Stress leads to buying more.
                FOMO and trying to impress people.
                Understand your triggers, thinking of ways to save will make you more conscious of your spending, patience, using cash reduces spending.
                The Psychology of Spending and How to Manage It | St. Mary's Bank
                
                Money can be stressful. Our subjective wealth perception is tied to comparing our objective wealth to a relative benchmark. Most Americans feel stress about money. It comes from not feeling in control. We view finances as the result of one individual. We feel shame when we’re not doing as well as we want. Businesses are getting better at getting us to spend money. With credit card debt, you can try to regain control by changing the payment date to something that works better for you.
                How can behavioral science help our spending habits? 5 questions for Wendy De La Rosa
                
                The pain of paying. Feelings of distress act as the brakes on spending.
                Spendthrifts vs tightwads- they tend to be conflicted.
                People value scarcity. They also value the framing of price. Online shopping needs speed bumps. Don’t save your card information. You need something to do before paying.
                I think that knowing all of this about money will make you more conscious of how you spend.
                Tightwads and spendthrifts: How emotions drive our shopping behavior, with Scott Rick, PhD
                
                The future seems far off. Money in the future is weighed less heavily than money now. We are biased to the present.
                Credit doesn’t seem real. The pain of paying is put off. Use cash instead.
                We don’t translate money into time. We look at our income on a grand scale, annual income, instead of directly translating our money into time.
                We don’t track our money. It’s difficult. Should be using financial trackers.

                “Learning by itself isn’t enough. You have to focus as much on the action that comes from the learning.”
                Learn from any experience, open to new things, and learn by doing.
                Learned to break things up so they can be done in 15 minute increments and still get value. Freedom on where to start reading.
                Learn from your upbringing- do a historical scan by identifying important events, asking why they’re important, and what does it say about who you were, are, and might become. Who had an impact on you and why?
                One way to reduce these fear of change is to assess and choose new environments carefully.
                4 elements- new knowledge, ideas, people, and influences for growth
                Some new environments will just slow you down.
                Be proactive about confronting your anxiety.
                You can fast track your knowledge by identifying your gaps, finding the right experts, and asking them everything.
                Start with experts that have applied their ideas in the real world.
                Seek out people who will say the painful truth.
                There’s more to learn in a crisis or failure than in a success.
                You can change how you move forward after failure.
                You cannot learn if you cannot listen. Listening produces better ideas and actions.
                When you listen, you should be present. Birdwatchers can only listen without making assumptions.
                “Listening is a way of offering others our scarcest, most precious gift: our attention.” (Adam Grant, Think Again).
                When asking questions, ‘should’ limits people more than ‘could’.
                Ask better questions. Ones that shift your perspective.
                “Never discount the question you’re going to ask”
                “Consciously work to avoid relying on assumptions, blanket categorizations, and limiting templates.”
                Expose yourself to many situations and experiences.
                Everyone has their own blind spots. Work to overcome your own.
                “Learn to see the world the way it really is, not how you wish it to be.” (Andy Pearson).
                “If you want to see the world the way it really is, you’ve got to hunt for the truth.”
                Patterns- Create something larger than the sum of its parts. Expose yourself to many ideas and patterns. Pattern thinking comes from being involved in multiple disciplines.
                Don’t wait for inspiration to make the leap. Work for the leap.
                Develop a practice of reflection. Make time for honest, vulnerable conversations with yourself.
                You need quiet moments to just think and process.
                Brains in focus mode (trying to accomplish something, uses existing neural paths) vs diffuse mode (more relaxed neural state, think, create, and process new ideas. Needs a break to think).
                “Humility is just the recognition that you can’t do it by yourself” and “Confidence is simply the expectation that you’ll find a way to win, somehow.” Both are necessary.
                Celebrate the ideas of others.
                We learn better when we’re feeling more positive emotions.
                Search for what blocked your joy to find what helps build your joy.
                Be your authentic self. Otherwise, you have to work at being someone else as well.
                Seek new challenges.
                Prime your brain for learning by preparing purposefully.
                Learn by doing hard things.
                Flip the script from pain to possibility
                Break the problem down to its simplest form, then ask a question.
                Spread what you know. (Aside from me, teaching is an excellent way to learn.)
                Teaching forces you to keep learning.
                The most effective thing a leader can do is to give an overarching culture and unity.
                Approach teaching as a discussion, and you will learn.
                Socratic method- asking thought-provoking questions that encourage listeners to come to their own conclusions.
                People should be the priority, not knowledge or results.
                You will never stop learning.
